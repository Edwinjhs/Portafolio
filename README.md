# PORTFOLIO Using Django
### By Edwin Hern√°ndez
This is my personal portfolio, built with Django and Python. In this project, I've used a virtual environment (env) to ensure that the required packages and versions are the same on whatever system this code is running on.


## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (to install project dependencies)
- Virtualenv (to create and activate the virtual environment)

Once you have installed these requirements, you can create the virtual environment and install the project dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate (para macOS o Linux)
env\Scripts\activate (para Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


To run the project, make sure you have enabled the virtual environment and are in the root folder of the project. Then run:

- python manage.py runserver
